**Holiday Coding Challenge**

*Assignment*: "Build a Festive Greeting Card
Design a holiday greeting card with HTML & CSS. Add a snowy background, a holiday message, and festive colors. Bonus: Add hover effects!"

I was very excited to recieve this prompt on the day that I finished my annual holiday music playlist. This assignment gave me an opportunity to encase my playlist in a lovely little virtual card to send my friends and family. It also provided those who might not have a Spotify account a way to listen to it.

**Tech Used / Process** 
I created a design sketch using Figma. My goal was to keep the design simple and responsive and work on some fun animation techniques. I looked online and found some animation tutorials and advice, and implemented those. 

- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
